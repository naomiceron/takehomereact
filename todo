//Todo.
//here are the things that I would have liked to do but didn't because of the time

//1. Add a modal to confirm you want to delete or cancel
//2. Add more validations so text is not needed in the create and update (colors to the textfields or something to let the user know)
//3. Move code that repeats to a utils class
//4. Have update and delete button in each item from the widget list would allow me to remove update button and delete button
//5. In the single widget (search) add an autocomplete
//6. Add more css styles to make it look cohesive
